# The Expressive Triad
[Paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.612923/full); [Supplemental Materials](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.612923/full#supplementary-material)

This project investigates whether a machine learning algorithm can objectively and automatically compute expressive content from neutral facial images utilizing low-level features of the face.

(Self-contained Docker image, models, and code coming soon!)
