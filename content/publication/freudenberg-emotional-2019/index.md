abstract: Individuals use na√Øve emotion theories, including stereotypical information
  on the emotional disposition of an interaction partner, to form social impressions.
  In view of an aging population in Western societies, beliefs on emotion and age
  become more and more relevant. Across 10 studies, we thus present findings on how
  individuals associate specific affective states with young and old adults using
  the emotion implicit association test. The results of the studies are summarized
  in 2 separate mini meta-analyses. Participants implicitly associated young adult
  individuals with positive emotions, that is, happiness and serenity, respectively,
  and old adult individuals with negative emotions, that is, sadness and anger, respectively
  (Mini Meta-Analysis 1). Within negative emotions, participants preferentially associated
  young adult individuals with sadness and old adult individuals with anger (Mini
  Meta-Analysis 2). Even though young and old adults are stereotypically associated
  with specific emotions, contextual factors influence which age-emotion stereotype
  is salient in a given context.
