abstract: It might seem a reasonable assumption that when we are not actively using
  our faces to express ourselves (i.e., when we display nonexpressive, or neutral
  faces), those around us will not be able to read our emotions. Herein, using a variety
  of expression-related ratings, we examined whether age-related changes in the face
  can accurately reveal one’s innermost affective dispositions. In each study, we
  found that expressive ratings of neutral facial displays predicted self-reported
  positive/negative dispositional affect, but only for elderly women, and only for
  positive affect. These ﬁndings meaningfully replicate and extend earlier work examining
  age-related emotion cues in the face of elderly women (Malatesta et al., 1987a).
  We discuss these ﬁndings in light of evidence that women are expected to, and do,
  smile more than men, and that the quality of their smiles predicts their life satisfaction.
  Although ratings of old male faces did not signiﬁcantly predict self-reported affective
  dispositions, the trend was similar to that found for old female faces. A plausible
  explanation for this gender difference is that in the process of attenuating emotional
  expressions over their lifetimes, old men reveal less evidence of their total emotional
  experiences in their faces than do old women.
