abstract: Despite the prevalent use of neutral faces in expression research, the term
  neutral still remains ill-defined and understudied. A general assumption is that
  one’s overt attempt to pose a nonexpressive face results in a neutral display, one
  devoid of any expressive information. Ample research has demonstrated that nonexpressive
  faces do convey meaning, however, through emotion-resembling appearance. Here, we
  examined whether prior expressive information lingers on a face, in the form of
  emotion residue, and whether despite overt attempts to display a neutral face, these
  subtle emotion cues influence trait impressions. Across three studies, we found
  that explicit attempts at posing neutral displays retained emotion residue from
  a prior expression. This residue in turn significantly impacted the impressions
  formed of these otherwise “neutral” displays. We discuss implications of this work
  for better understanding how accurate impressions are derived from the so-called
  neutral faces and underscore theoretical and methodological considerations for future
  research.
