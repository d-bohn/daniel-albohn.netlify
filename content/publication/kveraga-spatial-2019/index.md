abstract: 'Facial emotion is an important cue for deciding whether an individual is
  potentially helpful or harmful. However, facial expressions are inherently ambiguous
  and observers typically employ other cues to categorize emotion expressed on the
  face, such as race, sex, and context. Here, we explored the effect of increasing
  or reducing different types of uncertainty associated with a facial expression that
  is to be categorized. On each trial, observers responded according to the emotion
  and location of a peripherally presented face stimulus and were provided with either:
  (1) no information about the upcoming face; (2) its location; (3) its expressed
  emotion; or (4) both its location and emotion. While cueing emotion or location
  resulted in faster response times than cueing unpredictive information, cueing face
  emotion alone resulted in faster responses than cueing face location alone. Moreover,
  cueing both stimulus location and emotion resulted in a superadditive reduction
  of response times compared with cueing location or emotion alone, suggesting that
  feature-based attention to emotion and spatially selective attention interact to
  facilitate perception of face stimuli. While categorization of facial expressions
  was significantly affected by stable identity cues (sex and race) in the face, we
  found that these interactions were eliminated when uncertainty about facial expression,
  but not spatial uncertainty about stimulus location, was reduced by predictive cueing.
  This demonstrates that feature-based attention to facial expression greatly attenuates
  the need to rely on stable identity cues to interpret facial emotion.'
