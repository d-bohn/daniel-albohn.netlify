abstract: A social-functional approach to face processing comes with a number of assumptions.
  First, given that humans possess limited cognitive resources, it assumes that we
  naturally allocate attention to processing and integrating the most adaptively relevant
  social cues. Second, from these cues, we make behavioral forecasts about others
  in order to respond in an efficient and adaptive manner. This assumption aligns
  with broader ecological accounts of vision that highlight a direct action-perception
  link, even for nonsocial vision. Third, humans are naturally predisposed to process
  faces in this functionally adaptive manner. This latter contention is implied by
  our attraction to dynamic aspects of the face, including looking behavior and facial
  expressions, from which we tend to overgeneralize inferences, even when forming
  impressions of stable traits. The functional approach helps to address how and why
  observers are able to integrate functionally related compound social cues in a manner
  that is ecologically relevant and thus adaptive.
