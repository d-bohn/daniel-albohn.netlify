abstract: Recently, speed of presentation of facially expressive stimuli was found
  to influence the processing of compound threat cues (e.g., anger/fear/gaze). For
  instance, greater amygdala responses were found to clear (e.g., direct gaze anger/averted
  gaze fear) versus ambiguous (averted gaze anger/direct gaze fear) combinations of
  threat cues when rapidly presented (33 and 300 ms), but greater to ambiguous versus
  clear threat cues when presented for more sustained durations (1, 1.5, and 2 s).
  A working hypothesis was put forth (Adams et al., 2012) that these effects were
  due to differential magnocellular versus parvocellular pathways contributions to
  the rapid versus sustained processing of threat, respectively. To test this possibility
  directly here, we restricted visual stream processing in the fMRI environment using
  facially expressive stimuli specifically designed to bias visual input exclusively
  to the magnocellular versus parvocellular pathways. We found that for magnocellular-biased
  stimuli, activations were predominantly greater to clear versus ambiguous threat-gaze
  pairs (on par with that previously found for rapid presentations of threat cues),
  whereas activations to ambiguous versus clear threat-gaze pairs were greater for
  parvocellular-biased stimuli (on par with that previously found for sustained presentations).
  We couch these findings in an adaptive dual process account of threat perception
  and highlight implications for other dual process models within psychology.
