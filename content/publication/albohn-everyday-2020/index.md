abstract: 'The evolution of the human brain and visual system is widely believed to
  have been shaped by the need to process and make sense out of expressive information,
  particularly via the face. We are so attuned to expressive information in the face
  that it informs even stable trait inferences (e.g., Knutson, 1996) through a process
  we refer to here as the face-speciﬁc fundamental attribution error (Albohn et al.,
  2019). We even derive highly consistent beliefs about the emotional lives of others
  based on emotion-resembling facial appearance (e.g., low versus high brows, big
  versus small eyes, etc.) in faces we know are completely devoid of overt expression
  (i.e., emotion overgeneralization effect: see Zebrowitz et al., 2010). The present
  studies extend these insights to better understand lay beliefs about older and younger
  adults’ emotion dispositions and their impact on behavioral outcomes. In Study 1,
  we found that older versus younger faces objectively have more negative emotion-resembling
  cues in the face (using computer vision), and that raters likewise attribute more
  negative emotional dispositions to older versus younger adults based just on neutral
  facial appearance (see too Adams et al., 2016). In Study 2, we found that people
  appear to encode these negative emotional appearance cues in memory more so for
  older than younger adult faces. Finally, in Study 3 we exam downstream behavioral
  consequences of these negative attributions, showing that observers’ avoidance of
  older versus younger faces is mediated by emotion-resembling facial appearance.'
